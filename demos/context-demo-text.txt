Ruby Chen March 1, 2023 Authors Greg Brockman Atty Eleti Elie Georges Joanne Jang Logan Kilpatrick Rachel Lim Luke Miller Michelle Pokrass Product , Announcements ChatGPT and Whisper models are now available on our API, giving developers access to cutting-edge language (not just chat!) and speech-to-text capabilities. Through a series of system-wide optimizations, we’ve achieved 90% cost reduction for ChatGPT since December; we’re now passing through those savings to API users.
